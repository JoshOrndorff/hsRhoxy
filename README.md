hs Rhoxy
--------
An aspiring interpreter for rholang, written in haskell.

Usage
-----
Build with `cabal new-build`

and then run `rhoxy examples/send.rhoc`

Status
------
Basically just a playground right now. There is a less-than-implemented rhocalc parser. Don't expect to do anything other than learn atm.
